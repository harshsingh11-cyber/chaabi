## Features

- React: The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable components and provides a declarative approach to building UIs.

- Webpack: Webpack is used as the module bundler for this project. It helps bundle all the JavaScript, CSS, and other assets into a single file, optimizing the application for performance.

- Babel: Babel is used to transpile modern JavaScript syntax into a version of JavaScript that is supported by the target browsers. This allows developers to use the latest JavaScript features without worrying about browser compatibility.

- CSS Modules: The project uses CSS Modules to encapsulate CSS styles within components. This helps avoid style conflicts and promotes reusability.

- ESlint: ESlint is set up with a basic configuration to ensure code quality and enforce consistent coding standards. It helps catch common programming errors and maintain a clean codebase.
